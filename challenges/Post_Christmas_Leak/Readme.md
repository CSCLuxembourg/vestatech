# Is this the real _data_ life? 
# Is this just _leaking_ fantasy? 
# Caught in a landslide _of information_ 
# No escape from _confidential_ reality 
# Open your eyes _on the alternate data stream_
# Look up to the skies and see _password won't be 123456_
# I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy _nor NTFS volumes_
# Because I'm easy come, easy go _leaking everywhere_
# A little high, little low _lot's of data_
# Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me _exept for that Flag_.
