- Is this the real <b>_data_</b> life? 
- Is this just <b>_leaking_</b> fantasy? 
- Caught in a landslide <b>_of  .7z_</b> 
- No escape from <b>_zipped_</b> reality 
- Open your eyes <b>_on the alternate data stream_</b>
- Look up to the skies and see <b>_password shouldn't be 123456_</b>
- I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy <b>_nor NTFS volumes_</b>
- Because I'm easy come, easy go <b>_leaking everywhere_</b>
- A little high, little low <b>_for everyone to see_</b>
- Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me <b>_exept for that Flag_</b>.
