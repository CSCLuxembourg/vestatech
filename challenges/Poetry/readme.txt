Not a red rose or a satin heart.
A Friday was the good option.
A hidden .js attachment to start.
No complex need for caution.
Blue eternal tears would impart.

Here my friend. Click me. 
Should you want to - no need to cry.
Too late, see yourself as a lessee.
Nothing money or brokers shan't buy.
For trojan shadows to grow to an apogee.

Not a repository will resist.
Look! All your base! Encrypted.
Brace yourself, Bitcoins are requested.
So as MalwareTech, search for this Flag.
As a famous kill switch URL would be a nag.
To let you drift again free - through the digital mist.


300$ worth of Poetry, M. Farcot
