Neither red rose nor satin heart.
For Friday was the chosen option.
Dot js attachments were the start.
Confusing complex needs for caution.
Eternal blue tears ready to impart.

Traumatic tales of cyberInsecurity.

I know you want to - just click me.
I promise - no tears - I won't cry.
Yes, my love, you won't break free.
For trojan shadows darken the sky.

No repository can resist.
Your life. Encrypted.
Bitcoins requested.
Find the Flag.
The kill switch URL is the tag.
To drift in the 0 day mist...
