Not a red rose or a satin heart.
A Friday was the good option.
A hidden .js attachment to start.
No complex need for caution.
Blue eternal tears would impart.

Here my friend. Click me. 
Should you want to - no need to cry.
Too late! See yourself as a lessee!
Nothing money or brokers shan't buy.
For trojan shadows will grow to an apogee.

Not a repository will resist.
Look! All your base! Encrypted.
Brace yourself! Bitcoins are requested!
Now as MalwareTech, search for this Flag.
As a famous kill switch URL would be a nag.
To let you drift again free - through a digital mist.


300$ worth of Poetry, M. Farcot
