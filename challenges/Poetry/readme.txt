Not a red rose nor a satin heart.
A Friday was the good option.
This cunning .js attachment to start.
Forget complex need for caution.
Eternal blue tears were soon to impart.

Here my friend. No worry - just click me. 
Should you want to - I promise - you won't cry.
And too late! Feel yourself as a lessee!
For nothing money or brokers shan't buy.
The trojan shadows are at the apogee.

Not a repository can resist.
Look! All your base! Encrypted!
Brace yourself! Bitcoins requested!
Just as MalwareTech, search for this Flag.
As the famous kill switch URL is the nag.
To let you drift free - in this 0 day mist.


300$ worth of Poetry, M. Farcot
