Not a red rose or a satin heart.
A Friday was the good option.
A cunning .js attachment to start.
Forget complex need for caution.
Eternal blue tears were soon to impart.

Here my friend. No worry - just click me. 
Should you want to - I promise - no need to cry.
Though too late! See yourself as a lessee!
Now nothing money or brokers shan't buy.
For the trojan shadows are at an apogee.

Not a repository can resist.
Look! All your base! Encrypted!
Brace yourself! Bitcoins requested!
Just as MalwareTech, search for this Flag.
As the famous kill switch URL is the nag.
To let you drift free - in the 0 day mist.


300$ worth of Poetry, M. Farcot
