Not a red rose or a satin heart.
A Friday was the good option.
A hidden .js attachment to start.
No complex need for caution.
Blue eternal tears would impart.

Here my friend. Click me. 
Should you want to - no need to cry.
Too late! See yourself as a lessee!
Nothing money or brokers shan't buy.
For trojan shadows are at an apogee.

Not a repository will resist.
Look! All your base! Encrypted!
Brace yourself! Bitcoins requested!
Now as MalwareTech, search for this Flag.
As the famous kill switch URL is the nag.
To let you drift again free - in digital mist.


300$ worth of Poetry, M. Farcot
