Not a red rose or a satin heart.
A Friday was the good option.
A hidden .js attachment to start.
No complex need for caution.
Blue eternal tears would soon impart.

Here my friend. No worry - just click me. 
Should you want to - I promise - no need to cry.
Though too late! See yourself as a lessee!
Now nothing money or brokers shan't buy.
For trojan shadows are at an apogee.

Not a repository can resist.
Look! All your base! Encrypted!
Brace yourself! Bitcoins requested!
Just as MalwareTech, search for this Flag.
As the famous kill switch URL is the nag.
To let you drift free - in digital mist.
