# Vestatech repository

[VestaTech](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/vestatech-luxembourg), a fictitious
Luxembourgish start-up is in an armsrace with a large international conglomerate to reach
for and exploit the resources of a close by asteroid.

This is the repository for all of the challenges related to the first edition of the Cyber Security Challenge Luxembourg (season 2018/2019).

Join us in this imaginative adventure where not everyone will play fair.
